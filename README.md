## General Information

**ASIO Link Pro Patcher** is a tool that enables one to patch ASIO Link Pro to enable continued use of all of its features despite the software becoming unsupported following the unfortunate passing of its developer. To clarify, ASIO Link Pro is no longer available for purchase and existing customers have no recourse with which to continue using the software they purchased through normal means.

### Usage

- If ASIO Link Pro is installed in the default directory, simply run the patcher from any location and click **"Apply Patch"**.
- The patcher will also check its own directory for the necessary files.
- If the required file is not found in either location, you will be prompted to locate it manually.
